## 📖 Project Description

### 1. The Project

The goal of TrombArea is to explore and implement a complete software platform by developing a business application. You will create a suite of software that functions similarly to IFTTT/Zapier, divided into three main parts:

- **Application Server**: Implements all the business logic and features.
- **Web Client**: Provides a user interface accessible via a web browser that communicates with the server.
- **Mobile Client**: Offers mobile access to the application via REST API calls.

*Note: No business processes are executed on the web or mobile clients; they serve solely as user interfaces redirecting requests to the application server.*

### 2. Features

TrombArea offers the following functionalities:

- **User Registration**: Users sign up to create an account.
- **Account Confirmation**: Registered users confirm their accounts before using the application.
- **Service Subscription**: Authenticated users subscribe to various services.
- **Components per Service**:
  - **Action Components**: Trigger events (e.g., new email received, file uploaded).
  - **REAction Components**: Define responses (e.g., save attachment, post message).
- **AREA Creation**: Users compose custom workflows by linking an Action with a REAction.
- **Automatic Triggers**: The application automatically triggers workflows based on predefined conditions.
