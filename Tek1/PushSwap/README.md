# Pushswap

Pushswap is a C project aimed at sorting a list of integers in an ultra-optimized way using a limited set of stack operations. The main challenge is to implement efficient algorithms to handle very large lists with the minimum number of moves.

## Objectives
- Sort a list of integers using a restricted set of operations (push, swap, rotate, reverse rotate).
- Optimize the sorting process to minimize the number of operations.
- Implement algorithms adapted to stack constraints (insertion sort, optimized quicksort, etc.).

## Usage
The program takes an unsorted list of integers as input and outputs an optimized sequence of operations to sort the list.

```bash
make re

./push_swap 4 2 1 3 5 ... n
```
